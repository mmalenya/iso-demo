# iso-demo
Spring boot application to show authentication and authorization.

Application has been containerized

Issues: For demonstration purposes, application should use MySQL database container, loading data using volumes in docker compose. This is still a work in progress.
Application should be started using "docker-compose up" in the root folder.
